## x.08 Alpha How to use: 
* 8 Assignable buttons that are pre-populated to keys. Change key with R3
* Change Root with L3
* Bass notes currently assignable via both joysticks + pressing a button (Very esoteric for now)
* Change 5: Change octave with d-pad up/down
There's now 73 Notes instead of 16 per instrument. (File size is a problem, since GMS2 re-encodes to high encoding)
