Use an Xbox controller to play classic SNES samples

New features coming soon! Check the [changelog](https://github.com/crawsome/Controllerchestra/blob/main/CHANGELOG) for progress!

## How to use: 
The 4 face buttons all start at C3. You can modify their notes by holding the R buttons to increase their tone. Let go of the R button to save the note as-is.
